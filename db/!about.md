### Popup Hunting Tips

-   Use a clean residential (non VPN) IP based in the US. You can check your IP quality using the [IPQS Proxy Detection Test](https://www.ipqualityscore.com/free-ip-lookup-proxy-vpn-test). Other locations such as the UK, Australia & Japan may get results too.
-   Use Chromium based browsers such as [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome/), [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoft.com/edge/) or [Brave](https://brave.com/).
-   Hunt during business hours on business days. Ensure it's not a holiday in [India](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/india/) or [America](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/).
